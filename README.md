# Corpus Terms Co-Occurring With Common Workplace Vocabulary for English Learning 

> Context-Word-Embeddings

Ben's Data Science term project in which I use embeddings to curate lists of English word and related words for learners 

My goal is to provide a means of finding similar and related words for a list of target words for a specific context (i.e., occupational or spoken English) for English learners by using embeddings to analyze the COCA corpus.

This goal aims to meet the needs of adult English learners English-predominant countries (esp. the United States) by helping learners and teachers select target words to make their time spent learning more efficient and meaningful

I will get there by using embeddings in vector semantics. I will locate a list of seed words to use, starting with occupational English words (i.e., broadly related to the workplace). Then Iâ€™ll do various analyses (or choose one depending on difficulty) with the COCA to find words-in-context, closely related, or associated words for each target word. The product will be a dataset with the target words and their related words based on the COCA. A visualization of related words in a two-dimensional (t-SNE) projection will be helpful.
