"##4113706 The top U.S. general , visiting Israel at a delicate and dangerous moment in the global standoff with Tehran , is expected to press for restraint amid fears that the Jewish state is nearing a decision to attack Iran 's nuclear program . # Thursday 's arrival of Army Gen. Martin Dempsey , just four months after he took office as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , underscores Washington 's concern about a possible Israeli military strike . # It also spotlights key questions at the center of the global maneuvering to prevent an Iranian bomb : # How effective are the current economic sanctions in pressuring Iran 's leadership ? Israel wants a far tougher regime , while the Americans seem confident the current path will suffice . # Could aerial bombardment or missile strikes , the expected Israeli military toolkit , damage nuclear installations deep underground enough to be worth a counterstrike from Iran ? Some think Israel is mainly saber-rattling to scare governments into tougher sanctions . # Might covert activity suffice ? Iranian scientists and military officials have been killed , computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denials abound ; evidence about who 's behind it all does not . # Could Israel really surprise Washington , its main ally and protector , with a military move that could affect America itself , in an election year to boot ? Israeli officials have not pledged to give advance warning . # In the background , rarely openly discussed , is the somewhat prickly relationship between the Obama administration and the rightist government in Israel . The antipathy , born largely of disagreements on the Palestinian front , may not be helping navigate a situation as delicate as Iran . # But the main thing for Israel is the acute sense that a Rubicon is about to be crossed that a nuclear-armed Iran , whose President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calls for Israel 's destruction , is a direct existential threat . # Most of the West does agree with Israel that Iran , despite denials , is developing nuclear weapons technology . But the United States is clearly concerned that a military attack could backfire , fragmenting international opposition to Iran and sending oil prices skyrocketing. # Beginning Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netanyahu and much of Israel 's political and military leadership . Israeli officials involved in the preparations for the meetings said they expected Dempsey to urge restraint as the U.S. tries to rally additional global pressure on Iran . They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the visit . # In a joint statement , the U.S. and Israel said the visit would focus on "" cooperation between the two militaries , as well as mutual security challenges . "" # Israeli Cabinet Minister Dan Meridor , whose responsibilities include monitoring the Iranian nuclear program , said there was broad agreement with the Americans and the West on the need to stop the Iranians . "" If the sanctions work , then all the other options will remain strictly theoretical , "" he said . # An air raid on Iran would require flying over potentially hostile Arab airspace and could well trigger a response from Iran , which possesses an arsenal of missiles capable of striking Israel . The Iranians could also encourage their proxies , Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soldiers based in the Persian Gulf might come under fire . Islamist backers of Iran could target civilians all over the world . # It also remains unclear how much damage an attack could inflict . Iran 's nuclear facilities are scattered throughout the country and buried deep underground . Israeli officials concede that any attack could set back , but not destroy , Iran 's nuclear ambitions . # Speaking with The Associated Press , a senior military official said Thursday that the threat is real . "" If you are talking about the use of power against Iran , any kind of power , and create any damage over there , yes , it can be done , "" the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity under military guidelines . # Israel has attacked nuclear sites in foreign countries before . In 1981 , Israeli warplanes destroyed an unfinished Iraqi nuclear reactor . In 2007 , Israeli aircraft destroyed a site in Syria that the U.N . nuclear watchdog deemed to be a secretly built nuclear reactor. # While Israel is unlikely to strike without coordinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft carriers and military bases in the Gulf , Israeli officials will not make any promises to Dempsey , the officials said . # This week , Netanyahu told lawmakers that four rounds of international sanctions "" have harmed the Iranians but not in a way that would stop their nuclear program . "" His deputy prime minister , Moshe Yaalon , expressed disappointment in a radio interview that the U.S. has delayed plans to expand sanctions , suggesting election-year considerations were to blame . # And in an interview published Thursday , the recently retired Israeli military intelligence chief claimed Iran already has all the components to build a nuclear bomb . "" If the Iranians get together tonight and decide to secretly develop a bomb , then they have all the resources and components to do so , "" Amos Yadlin told the Maariv daily . # In a balancing message , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that Israel was "" very far "" from deciding whether to strike . And Israel and the United States this week postponed a major military exercise . # Israelis generally assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a bomb but a year or two away from being able to build and deliver an atomic weapon . # In a possible preview of Dempsey 's message , a senior U.S. State Department official convened Israeli journalists on Wednesday and insisted American sanctions have been effective , Israeli newspapers reported . # The official , who was not identified , reportedly said sanctions were gradual to avoid a sudden jump in oil prices but could be ramped up to include an embargo on Iran 's central bank and were already having a harsh effect on Iran 's economy . # For more than three years , Tehran has blocked International Atomic Energy Agency attempts to follow up on U.S. and other intelligence alleging covert Iranian work on nuclear arms , dismissing the charges as baseless and insisting all its nuclear activities were peaceful . In November the IAEA issued a report saying some of Iran 's alleged experiments have no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons . # In Paris , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he hoped European Union foreign ministers will reach an accord at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petroleum exports and a freeze on the assets of the Iranian Central Bank . # The U.S. last month enacted similar sanctions , though it has delayed implementing them for at least six months in fear of sending oil prices higher at a time when the global economy is struggling . Iran has threatened to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz in response to sanctions . # At the Pentagon on Wednesday , U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the U.S. military was "" fully prepared "" to deal with any Iranian effort to close the Strait of Hormuz . Iran has threatened to close the strategic waterway , the route for about one-sixth of the global oil flow , because of new U.S. sanctions. # #"
"##4113707 Penn State trustees say they decided to oust Joe Paterno in part because the football coach did n't meet a moral obligation to do more to alert authorities about a child sex abuse allegation against a retired assistant coach . # Trustees interviewed Thursday by The Associated Press also cited statements from Paterno in the days and hours leading to his dismissal Nov. 9 after nearly a half-century of leading the Nittany Lions that they felt challenged the Board of Trustees authority . Board members saw that as inappropriate , particularly at a time of intense scrutiny over the case of former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. # Sandusky was charged with dozens of child sex abuse counts four days before Paterno was pushed out . The head coach had testified before a state grand jury about a 2002 allegation against Sandusky that was passed on to him by a graduate assistant . # A day after the graduate assistant , Mike McQueary , came to see him , Paterno relayed the accusations to his superiors , one of whom oversaw campus police . Board members did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a moral responsibility , for all adults to watch out for children , either your own or someone else , "" trustee Mark Dambly said . "" It was in our opinion that Joe Paterno did not meet his moral obligation and for that reason me , personally for that reason , I felt he could no longer lead the university and it was unanimous . "" # But Dambly and three other trustees interviewed Thursday on the Penn State campus said they still intended to honor Paterno 's accomplishments and contributions to the school . He won a Division I record 409 games over 46 seasons and the Paterno family has donated millions of dollars to the school . # "" Obviously Joe Paterno is a worldwide icon and has done a tremendous amount for the university , "" trustee Joel Myers said . "" We have sorrow and all kinds of emotions , empathy , sympathy for what has occurred . That 's universal . # "" But the university , this institution is greater than one person . "" # An attorney for Paterno on Thursday called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paterno fully reported what he knew to the people responsible for campus investigations , lawyer Wick Sollers said . # "" He did what he thought was right with the information he had at the time , "" Sollers said . # The trustees spoke out ahead of Friday 's board meeting , their first gathering since November and the frantic week after criminal charges were filed against Sandusky , once heralded as the architect for the storied program 's "" Linebacker U. "" defense . # The trustees described the long deliberations in the days leading up to Paterno 's ouster as emotional and nerve wracking , echoing the confusion and anguish also felt among students and alumni as the scandal unfolded . They were shocked by the lurid details that had emerged about the case that week , after having been given a short briefing about Sandusky months earlier by school President Graham Spanier and general counsel Cynthia Baldwin . That session lasted roughly 7 minutes and provided few insights , trustees said . # Paterno was dismissed the same day Spanier also departed under pressure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of Penn State officials . # Since then , some alumni and former players have been questioning the actions of the trustees . The criticism boiled over in three town hall-style meetings last week hosted for alumni by new school President Rodney Erickson. # According to Dambly , trustees had been advised not to speak because of the ongoing investigations but changed their minds following the town halls . # They began a series of interviews this week with media outlets . Also sitting in Thursday 's interview with the AP was Lanny Davis , a prominent Washington attorney who has been retained by Erickson and the trustees as an adviser . # "" It was clear that the alumni , students , faculty and general public were asking questions of the president that he was unable to answer , "" Dambly said . "" We determined as a group that the Board of Trustees needed to answer the questions of what we knew , when we knew it and why we made the decisions that we made . "" # The trustees on Thursday cited three reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral obligation to do more in conjunction with reporting the 2002 allegation and statements issued by Paterno they felt may have challenged trustees authority , the trustees also said there was concern that Paterno would not be able to properly represent the school if allowed to stay on as head coach the rest of the 2011 season . # On Nov. 6 , as trustees began to arrive in State College in the wake of Sandusky 's arrest , some were surprised by a statement from Paterno made without consulting the university , trustee Stephanie Deviney said . At the time , Paterno 's son , lawyer Scott Paterno , had been also speaking on behalf of his father . # "" When we 're in the biggest crisis of this university , we all should have been coming together , and at that point we working separately , "" Deviney said . # In a statement the morning of Nov. 9 that caught the school off-guard , Paterno announced he was retiring effective the end of the year . At the time , Paterno said he was devastated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single minute discussing my status "" and had more important matters to address . # "" This is a tragedy , "" Paterno said then . "" It is one of the great sorrows of my life . With the benefit of hindsight , I wish I had done more . "" # Following a two-hour meeting later that night in which Dambly said the trustees came to a consensus , vice chair John Surma had an assistant athletic director relay a message to Paterno 's home to call him . By then , a large crowd of students and media were outside Paterno 's house . # According to The Washington Post , Surma told Paterno , "" In the best interests of the university , you are terminated . "" Paterno hung up and repeated the words to his wife , who redialed the number . # "" After 61 years he deserved better , "" Sue Paterno said . "" He deserved better . "" The she hung up . # According to Davis on Thursday , Surma never got the chance to say two more things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision over the phone ; and that the school was going to honor his contract and retirement package as if he had retired at the end of 2011. # Dambly insisted Paterno was not fired , although he never appeared as coach again . He remains a tenured faculty member , Dambly said . # Spanier , too , remains a tenured faculty member and is on sabbatical . The school has said that he had resigned , but trustees Thursday said his contract as president had been terminated . # With Spanier in attendance , general counsel Cynthia Baldwin had briefed the board about the grand jury investigation into Sandusky in May . Recounting the briefing , Dambly said Thursday trustees were led to believe the investigation was related to Sandusky 's charity for at-risk youth , The Second Mile , or activities in Lock Haven , a small town about 45 minutes north of State College . # Authorities have said Sandusky met his accusers through the charity . # Trustees typically get briefed on legal matters . The case was not presented in a way "" as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Trustees said they learned the details with the rest of the public on Nov. 5 : through newspaper , broadcast or online accounts . # The next day Spanier offered more details . He issued a statement calling the allegations troubling and adding that athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz had his unconditional support . # Schultz and Curley are awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to charges of perjury and failing to report the 2002 allegation to authorities . Curley is on administrative leave , while Schultz , whose department oversaw campus police , returned to retirement . # By Nov. 7 , Spanier 's support on the board had eroded , Myers said . # "" It was very emotional . How could this have happened , "" Myers said in recounting the deliberations and initial reaction to the allegations . "" This is the antithesis of what the university stood for . "" # Efforts Thursday by the AP to reach Spanier were not successful . # Paterno is battling lung cancer . His attorney , Sollers , issued a statement blasting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last 24 hours is insensitive , self-serving and unsupported by the facts , "" he said . "" Placing wholesale blame on Joe Paterno for the break down in Penn State 's investigative processes is a misguided attempt to distract the media and the public from scrutinizing the conduct of everyone involved . It is also irresponsible to claim that Joe Paterno has been afforded due process . "" # In a separate statement , the group Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship said the board 's comments have "" done nothing but raise additional questions . "" The group started in mid-November , growing out of what a spokeswoman said was a common frustration among members over a lack of due process at the school . # "" We can conclude , that consequently , their hasty and panicked damage control efforts in the first days of November , and the uncomfortable position they found themselves in , being caught flat-footed , instead of in a proactive leadership position , led to the unjust firing of Joe Paterno , without so much as a conversation , let alone complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Other critical alumni have called for wholesale changes in the board 's makeup , and more transparency into how the board operates . # Dambly said he hoped critics would look at the trustees recent comments objectively "" and that will I think to 90 percent to 99 percent of the world answer a lot of those questions .

"##4113708 Trey Junkin spent nearly every minute of his 19 years in the NFL trying to be invisible , and might have succeeded , if not for his very last snap . # That came at the end of a 2003 NFC playoff game , when a New York Giants team he had joined only four days earlier botched a last-gasp field goal to complete an epic meltdown against the 49ers and left Junkin to shoulder the blame . Nine years later , he is still toting up the costs and wondering whether even one of those teammates will come forward and share the burden . # "" I owned up to it that day and every day since , I 've owned every bit of it , "" Junkin said . "" It 's how I was brought up . But I think about that ... snap still . Not every day or every night anymore , but every now and then I get jerked out of my sleep and re-live that feeling the second the ball left my hands . And it brings the taste of vomit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is back home in Winnfield , La. , pop . 5,800 , helping out with the high school football team on occasion and watching dozens of NFL games every season with a notepad in his lap always charting special-teams play . He 'll be back in front of TV set Sunday when the Giants and 49ers meet again in the NFC championship , wondering if the game Junkin loved all his life will ever welcome him back . # "" I still feel bad for all 53 guys on that team . And the last thing I want , "" he said , "" is people to feel sorry for me . I 've got a wonderful wife , two great kids and my parents are still alive . Football gave me the means to enjoy all of it . # "" Do I want to get back in ? Absolutely . I 'd love to be a special-teams coach . I did it for a year in Canada ( with Calgary ) and loved every minute . I played every facet of special teams and still study it to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an interview . Everybody knows me , but nobody returns my calls ? I mean , c'm on , "" Junkin said , then paused and drew in a sharp breath . # "" I do n't want to lay it on that snap , "" he continued , "" but I do n't know what it is . I wish I did . "" # When that fateful January call came from New York , Junkin was 41 and had filed his NFL retirement papers two months earlier after playing for seven different teams as a long snapper and sometimes special-teams player . By his own count , he had messed up five or six snaps in 281 previous games . The Giants , meanwhile , had already lost three other long snappers during a season that began with low expectations , but thanks to a late surge , began to take on a championship feel . They built a 24-point lead at San Francisco and still led 38-22 beginning the final quarter when everything fell apart . Their last shot at redemption came on third down , trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped onto the field to attempt a 40-yard field goal . # What happened next remains a point of contention . All these years later , though , Junkin still is the only guy to take responsibility for his part . But if you made a list of those who blew assignments on the play , he might not even make the top 10. # For one , there 's Giants holder Matt Allen , who could have fallen on the ball and called timeout , leaving enough time for another try . Or , Allen could have run outside the tackle box which he did and thrown the ball out of bounds , stopping the clock with a few ticks left . Instead , he panicked and heaved an incomplete pass at teammate Rich Seubert. # Next would be the seven NFL officials on the field , backed by a quartet in the instant replay booth . They mistakenly believed Seubert normally an offensive lineman was an ineligible receiver and so refused to call pass interference when San Francisco 's Chike Okeafor pulled Seubert down from behind on the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" I was n't going to let him catch it , score and be over then , "" he said . But it was n't until Monday that the league got around to acknowledging its role in the fiasco . Though another Giants lineman was downfield on the same play , Seubert was indeed eligible . NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue later called it the worst officiating blunder of his tenure . At the least , offsetting penalties should have been called and the down replayed. # Then there 's the offense , which fizzled after building the big lead , and the defense , which gave it away , and finally , then-coach Jim Fassel , who could have been a little more assertive about the missed call and a lot less conservative in his play-calling. # "" It 's still kind of amazing , "" Fassel told the Newark ( N.J. ) Star-Ledger earlier this week . "" The referee announced over the PA system that No. 69 is eligible . So there were 90,000 people who knew Seubert was eligible . The only one who did n't know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rekick. "" # Instead , Junkin stood dutifully in front of his locker as wave after wave of reporters asked questions . # "" I 'd give everything in the world , except my family , to have stayed retired so these guys could have had a chance , "" he said at the time , then watched a replay and good as his word , promptly re-retired on the spot . # "" You ca n't fault Trey , "" said Fassel , who lost his own job soon after . "" I remember he said it cost us the Super Bowl , but I do n't want him to feel that way . To let a team come from behind like that , they get a lot of help . And the referee was clearly wrong , so that part was hard to swallow . "" # Yet Junkin repeated his version of events a day later in New York after cleaning out his locker . Among all his teammates , only Michael Strahan and Jeremy Shockey went out of their way to cushion the blow . # "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't play defense . You did n't have a hand in giving back 24 points , ' "" Junkin recalled . "" Shockey said something similar . And I talked to Kerry Collins about hunting , I think , but that was pretty much it . I talked to Jim a week later . He apologized , and said the same things Strahan and Shockey did . ... I think I drank three nights straight after the game . I can only remember one of them . # "" I was such a perfectionist . I thought if I did my job right , no one outside the game would even know who I was . And everybody that knows me was worried for a little bit after that because they know how neurotic I am or was about snapping . I had to know where every snap was caught by the punter or holder . I needed to know where the laces were , stuff like that , because those were the things I could control . # "" But another thing I learned playing the game that long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , "" and here Junkin dragged out the words for emphasis , "" as a team . "" # "" And if I had a wish , it 's that when this whole thing gets hashed over , people who remember that snap remember it 's one play out of an entire game , "" he said . # Junkin plans to watch it without a notepad this once in the bar at a nearby resort casino . He and his wife made reservations to celebrate his 51st birthday over the weekend . # "" I 'm curious how many times they show my face . I never played football to have my name known . You can be pretty anonymous with a helmet on and I wanted to keep it that way . The funny thing is that was the only time I ever walked out of the tunnel and down the middle of the field .

"##4113710 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will deliver fresh water to four homes in a northeastern Pennsylvania village where residential water wells were tainted by a gas driller . The agency also said it will begin testing the water supplies of dozens more homes as it ramps up its investigation more than three years after homeowners say the water supply was ruined . # Capping a tumultuous two weeks in which EPA first promised the residents a tanker of water and then quickly backed away , saying more study was needed federal environmental regulators said they have concluded that contaminant levels in four of the homes pose a health hazard and require emergency action . Some of the water samples , the agency said , were found to be polluted with cancer-causing arsenic and synthetic chemicals typically found in drilling fluids. # The first delivery of water is scheduled for Friday . # "" I ca n't even tell you , again , what a relief this is. because that 's all we 've asked for water , "" said Julie Sautner , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample water at 61 homes in the area of Carter and Meshoppen roads "" to assess further whether any residents are being exposed to hazardous substances that cause health concerns . "" The testing , to be carried out over the next several weeks , marks a significant expansion of the agency 's probe in Dimock , a tiny crossroads at the center of a national debate over gas drilling and the extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing , or fracking. # More than a dozen homeowners in Dimock say they have been without a reliable supply of clean water since Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp. , the Houston-based drilling firm blamed for polluting their aquifer , won permission from state regulators to halt daily deliveries on Nov. 30. # After analyzing sampling data provided by Cabot , the residents , and the state Department of Environmental Protection , EPA said hazardous substances were found in the water wells of several homes . But only in four homes were they in high enough concentrations to present a health threat , the agency said . EPA said it might provide water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the results of its own testing , # "" EPA is working diligently to understand the situation in Dimock and address residents concerns , "" EPA Regional Administrator Shawn M. Garvin said in a statement . "" We believe that the information provided to us by the residents deserves further review , and conducting our own sampling will help us fill information gaps . Our actions will be based on the science and the law and we will work to help get a more complete picture of water quality for these homes in Dimock. "" # EPA said the federal Superfund program the environmental fund used to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites authorized it to take emergency action in Dimock. # It 's not clear how many wells in Dimock were affected by the drilling , which began in 2008 . The state has found that at least 18 residential water wells were fouled by stray methane gas from Cabot 's drilling operation , although EPA said Thursday that its own door-to-door survey turned up 20 water wells on those same parcels . # Cabot , which was banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , took legal responsibility for the methane found in the wells , but contends that water wells in the area were tainted with the gas long before the company arrived . The company also says it met a state deadline to restore or replace Dimock 's water supply , installing treatment systems in some houses that have removed the methane . # But 11 homeowners who are suing Cabot say their aquifer is still tainted with methane and also with toxic chemicals that are used in fracking , a technique in which water , sand and chemicals are blasted deep underground to free natural gas from dense rock deposits like the Marcellus Shale found in Pennsylvania and surrounding states . Cabot denies responsibility for the presence of any chemicals found in the wells . # EPA said the sampling data it reviewed turned up hazardous levels of substances including : # arsenic , a cancer-causing element that may be present in elevated concentrations due to drilling ; # barium , a silvery-white metal and a common constituent in drilling fluids that can damage the kidneys with extended exposure . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible , a probable human carcinogen ; also used in drilling ; # glycols , including ethylene glycol , an antifreeze commonly found in drilling fluids ; # manganese , a naturally occurring substance that is sometimes used in drilling fluids and can damage the central nervous system if ingested . # EPA 's decision to intervene in Dimock is unlikely to sit well with Pennsylvania 's environmental chief , Michael Krancer , who has accused the EPA of having only a "" rudimentary "" understanding of the situation there . # Krancer , a frequent EPA critic who serves under pro-drilling GOP Gov . Tom Corbett , urged Garvin in a letter released publicly last week to allow any EPA probe to "" be guided by sound science and the law instead of emotion and publicity . "" # DEP spokeswoman Katy Gresh said after the EPA announcement Thursday that "" EPA does not seem to have presented any new data here . More than a year ago , DEP 's enforcement action addressed this issue and ensured funds were set aside to resolve the water quality issues for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sampling is necessary in Dimock and is working with its federal counterpart . # Cabot rejected EPA 's characterization of the sampling data and insisted that Dimock 's drinking water meets federal standards . # "" Cabot believes that the US EPA has a flawed interpretation of the data and has taken it out of context ; this has resulted in an unwarranted investigation by US EPA regarding water quality . PADEP has extensively investigated alleged groundwater concerns in the Dimock area and concluded , using sound science , that it was safe , "" Cabot spokesman George Stark said in a statement. # #"
"##4113712 Facing newly barbed questions about his wealth , Mitt Romney on Thursday refused to bow to pressure to immediately release his tax returns in the rocky home stretch of South Carolina 's Republican primary . Though still the front-runner for the nomination , Romney also lost his claim to an Iowa victory just as Newt Gingrich emerged as a stronger threat . # "" If I 'm the nominee , I 'll put these out at one time , "" Romney said of his tax returns in a Republican presidential debate Thursday night . # Gingrich pressed Romney to release his tax returns ahead of the South Carolina primary Saturday . "" If there 's anything that 's in there that 's going to help us lose the election , we should know before the election , "" he said . Gingrich released his own tax returns Thursday night , showing he made over $3.1 million in 2010 and paid $994,708 in taxes . # Romney barely mentioned the tax returns in campaign events here as he has been dogged by questions about his personal wealth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 10 days . # In the debate Thursday , Romney said arguments between two of his rivals were "" in my view a perfect example of why we need to send to Washington someone who had not lived in Washington , but someone who has lived in the real streets of America . "" Romney has three homes , in California , Massachusetts and New Hampshire . # Romney grew up the son of Michigan governor and car company president George Romney , who released 12 years worth of tax returns during his 1968 campaign for president . When asked during the debate if he planned to follow his father 's example or if he would release fewer years , Romney said : "" Maybe . "" # The former Massachusetts governor has reluctantly agreed to release the tax returns but has spurned calls from his rivals and even allies including key supporter New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie to do so immediately . Romney also has not yet explained why he keeps part of his fortune in the Cayman Islands . His campaign says he does not receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Romney 's campaign on details of his holdings was just one element of a political day that underscored the unpredictability of Saturday 's South Carolina primary . # In a blow to Romney , Texas Gov . Rick Perry dropped out of the race and endorsed Gingrich , a move that could start to consolidate conservative support behind the former House speaker . # That shrunk the field , leaving Romney and Gingrich on stage Thursday night with just Texas Rep. Ron Paul and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum . Santorum claimed an Iowa win during the day the state party said he did have the biggest share of the votes it could count and he continued to fight Gingrich for the mantle of Romney 's chief conservative foe . # Romney barely mentioned Perry at all , leaving him out of a speech to supporters and only mentioning him in passing when pressed by reporters afterward. # "" Terrific guy , terrific conservative , "" Romney said . "" We 're going to miss him on stage tonight . "" # But Romney also was grappling with the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 votes in the final tally of the state 's caucuses , though no winner has been declared . At the very least , it was a symbolic setback for a Romney campaign reeling from a series of bumps over the past few days . # In a written statement , Romney called the Iowa results a "" virtual tie "" and praised Santorum 's "" strong performance "" in the state . # It was a far different type of day when Romney touched down in South Carolina just over a week ago , coming off what appeared to be twin victories in Iowa and New Hampshire . # Since then , Romney has been confronted by attacks from his opponents on everything from his tax returns to his changed positions on social issues like abortion . And he 's made unforced errors talking about his own personal wealth and defending the private equity firm he founded , Bain Capital . # On Tuesday , Romney disclosed that he pays an effective tax rate of about 15 percent , lower than what he would pay if he earned a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capital gains and other returns on investments . He also called "" not very much "" the amount he earned in speechmaking fees : $373,327.62 for 12 months in 2010 and early 2011. # His campaign has repeatedly refused to answer more questions about his fortune , and the candidate himself has tried to change the subject by attacking Gingrich as he inches up in polls . # Regardless of the outcome of the primary Saturday , Romney 's past 10 days have played into the hands of Democrats who are looking to paint him as an out-of-touch multimillionaire during the general election . # In the meantime , Democrats planned a series of news conferences to argue that the work Romney did at Bain Capital was n't the same as bolstering American manufacturing . # President Barack Obama 's campaign advisers contend voters are unlikely to back a wealthy Republican with financial-industry ties at a time of lingering economic distress . # The questions about Romney 's wealth began last week in New Hampshire when he told an audience he knew what it was like to worry about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , he said , "" I like being able to fire people who provide services to me "" a comment about health insurance companies that his rivals used to paint Romney as out of touch with ordinary Americans . # In a moment that was clearly unscripted , Romney disclosed for the first time Tuesday that , despite his wealth of hundreds of millions of dollars , he has been paying taxes in the neighborhood of 15 percent , far below the top maximum income tax rate of 35 percent , because his income "" comes overwhelmingly from investments made in the past . "" # He 's also refused to answer questions about why he invests in funds that are domiciled in the Cayman Islands , a popular destination for international investments . An Associated Press examination of Romney 's 2012 presidential financial disclosure found at least six holdings in offshore-based funds totaling between $7 million and $32 million . There is no indication Romney used the accounts to dodge his U.S. tax obligations . # Depending how the funds are structured , though , some experts said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American investors to indefinitely defer the payment of taxes until the money returns to the U.S. # During 2010 and the first nine months of 2011 , the Romney family had at least $9.6 million in income , according to a financial disclosure form submitted in August . # The maximum marginal U.S. income tax rate of 35 percent applies in theory more than practice to households with taxable income of over about $388,500. # Stephen Braun in Washington contributed to this report. # #"
